# To-Do List with Reminders

## Overview
This project is a simple to-do list web application that allows users to add tasks along with a date and time. Users can mark tasks as complete, and tasks will be displayed in a structured format with the selected date and time.

## Features
- Add tasks with a custom date and time.
- Mark tasks as complete (strikethrough effect).
- Delete tasks when no longer needed.
- User-friendly design with a clean UI.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for the structure of the web page.
- **CSS** for styling and layout.
- **JavaScript** for dynamic task management.

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter a task in the input field.
3. Select a date and time for the task.
4. Click the "Add Task" button to add it to the list.
5. Click the checkbox to mark the task as complete.
6. Click the "Delete" button to remove the task.

## File Structure
- `index.html` - Main HTML file containing the structure and JavaScript functionality.

- `script.js` - JavaScript file to handle task interactions (if separated from HTML).

## Future Enhancements
